# DeepVision-RTX (Starter)

A CUDA C++ practice project for **RTX 4070 SUPER (Ada 8.9)** to build the same skills used for overlapping transfers with compute (streams + pinned memory), basic kernel optimization (1D & 2D grids), and event timing suitable for Nsight Systems/Compute.

## Whatâ€™s here?
- **Pinned host memory** + `cudaMemcpyAsync` to demonstrate overlap
- **Multiple streams** for concurrent copy/compute
- **Timed sections** with `cudaEventRecord` / `cudaEventElapsedTime`
- **Kernels**: `saxpy` (1D), `blur3x3_naive` (2D)

## Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/deepvision_rtx
```

## Profile (examples)
```bash
# Nsight Systems GUI (on host with CUDA Toolkit installed)
nsys profile -o nsys_report ./build/deepvision_rtx

# Nsight Compute single-kernel collection
ncu --set full --target-processes all ./build/deepvision_rtx
```

## Next steps
- Convert blur kernel to **shared-memory tiled** version
- Add **half-precision** path to prep for Tensor Cores
- Compare end-to-end with **cuDNN** and optionally TensorRT
```
